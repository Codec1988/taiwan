1)xmlparser needs the xml file as input argument in order to operate, i.e. "python xmlparser.py test.xml"

2)batchparser needs the data folder as argument, i.e. "sh batchparser data".
It uses the find command to spot every file ending in .xml in the subdirectories of the data folder and parses it.
The output csvfiles are stored in the newly created folder csvdump. 
If something went wrong while parsing a specific file, it should come out in the parserlog file.

I hope everything runs ok. If there is a problem feel free to message me!
